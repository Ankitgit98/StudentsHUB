                <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2021</h2>

                <p>At the top of the list is Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU), the world's largest
                    university in terms of student population. IGNOU has gone a long way toward fulfilling its goal of
                    providing higher education to everyone. It was founded in 1985 and has risen to tremendous heights
                    in a very short period of time. Dubbed the People's University, IGNOU has courses related to every
                    field in every possible form including face-to-face, online, and distance education. It has the
                    lowest fees of any university in India. <br>


                    There are three other open universities including Dr. Ambedkar Open University, Yashwantrao Chavan
                    Open University and the MP Bhoj University that make the list. <br>

                    In second place is the University of Mumbai (formerly known as Bombay University / University of
                    Bombay) which has the second fastest growth in student population after IGNOU. Earlier it was in the
                    seventh place but in less than five years it has moved into the second position. In addition to its
                    distance education program, University of Mumbai has a number of affiliated colleges. <br>

                    In 2010, The Uttar Pradesh Technical University (UPTU) split, forming the Gautam Buddha Technical
                    University(GBTU) and Mahamaya Technical University (MTU). In this list, both colleges are listed as
                    a single entity until further data is made available. <br>

                    The list has only one private university: Sikkim Manipal University (SMU) which posted impressive
                    numbers right from its founding in 1995. <br>


                    Though Banaras Hindu University is the biggest university in terms of the number of students who
                    live on campus, it is not included on this list because its total student population is around
                    40,000. It does however earn a place on the list of largest universities by campus size. <br>

                    Note: The numbers given below reflect the number of students taking courses directly from the
                    University, not affiliated colleges..</p>
